jquery.textarea.placeholder.with.carriagereturns.polyfill.js
=====
is a fork of jQuery Placeholder Newlines but with auto initilisation and some tidy ups.

It was concieved in response to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7189223/can-you-have-multiline-html5-placeholder-text-in-a-textarea and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7312623/insert-line-break-inside-placeholder-attribute-of-a-textarea
And having the need to have placeholder text that spanned multiple lines.


Usage
=====

<script src="jquery.textarea.placeholder.with.carriagereturns.polyfill.js"></script>

That's it!
Now you have working placeholder text with carriage-returns/new-lines on all of your textareas.
